Comfort and reassure the burned person. Give him aspirin or acetaminophen for the pain and codeine if you can get it. Bathing open wounds in slightly salty water also helps calm pain. Put 1 teaspoon of salt for each liter of cool, boiled water. Give the burned person plenty of liquid. If the burned area is large (more than twice the size of his hand), make up the following drink:  The burned person should drink this as often as possible, especially until he urinates frequently. He should try to drink 4 liters a day for a large burn, and 12 liters a day for a very large burn. It is important for persons who are badly burned to eat foods rich in protein (see p. 110). No type of food needs to be avoided. Burns around the Joints When someone is badly burned between the fingers, in the armpit, or at other joints, gauze pads with Vaseline on them should be put between the burned surfaces to prevent them from growing together as they heal. Also, fingers, arms, and legs should be straightened completely several times a day while healing. This is painful but helps prevent stiff scars that limit movement. While the burned hand is healing, the fingers should be kept in a slightly bent position.', 19),
('Broken Bones (Fractures)', 'When a bone is broken, the most important thing to do is keep the bone in a fixed position. This prevents further damage and lets it mend. Before trying to move or carry a person with a broken bone, keep the bones from moving with splints, strips of bark, or a sleeve of cardboard. Later a plaster cast can be put on the limb at a health center, or perhaps you can make a cast according to local tradition (see p. 14). Setting broken bones: If the bones seem more or less in the right position, it is better not to move them this could do more harm than good. If the bones are far out of position and the break is recent, you can try to set or straighten them before putting on cast. The sooner the bones are set, the easier it will be. Before setting, if possible inject or give diazepam to relax the muscles and calm pain', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'It is possible to do a lot of damage while trying to set a bone.

The worse the break or the older the person, the longer healing takes. Childrens bones mend rapidly. Those of old people sometimes never join. A broken arm should be kept in a cast for about a month, and no force put on it for another month. A broken leg should remain in a cast for about 2 months.  BROKEN THIGH OR HIP BONE A broken upper leg or hip often needs special attention. It is best to splint the whole body like this: and to take the injured person to a health center at once. BROKEN NECKS AND BACKS If there is any chance a persons back or neck has been broken, be very careful when moving him. Try not to change his position. If possible, bring a health worker before moving him. If you must move him, do so without bending his back or neck. For instructions on how to move the injured person, see the next page. BROKEN RIBS These are very painful, but almost always heal on their own. It is better not to splint or bind the chest. The best treatment is to take aspirin or acetaminophen (avoid giving aspirin to children) and rest. To keep the lungs healthy, take 4 to 5 deep breaths in a row, every 2 hours. Do this daily until you can breathe normally. At first, this will be very painful. It may take months before the pain is gone completely. A broken rib does not often puncture a lung. But if a rib breaks through the skin, or if the person coughs blood or develops breathing difficulties (other than pain), use antibiotics and seek medical help. BROKEN BONES THAT BREAK THROUGH THE SKIN (OPEN FRACTURES) Since the danger of infection is very great in these cases, it is always better to get help from a health worker or doctor in caring for the injury. Wear gloves or plastic bags on your hands and clean the wound and the exposed bone very gently but thoroughly with cool, boiled water. Cover with a clean cloth. Never put the bone back into the wound until the wound and the bone are absolutely clean. Splint the limb to prevent more injury. If the bone has broken the skin, use an antibiotic immediately to help prevent infection: dicloxacillin (p. 350), clindamycin (p. 358), or ciprofloxacin', 20),

Use crutches to give a sprained foot as much rest as possible. Serious sprains need at least 3 or 4 weeks to heal. Broken bones take longer. To relieve pain and swelling, keep the sprained part raised high. During the first day or two, put ice wrapped in cloth or plastic, or cold, wet cloths over the swollen joint for 20 to 30 minutes once every hour. This helps reduce swelling and pain. After 24 to 48 hours (when the swelling is no longer getting worse), soak the sprain in hot water several times a day. You can keep the twisted joint in the correct position for healing by using a homemade cast (see p. 14) or an elastic bandage. Wrapping the foot and ankle with an elastic bandage will also prevent or reduce swelling. Start from the toes and wrap upward, as shown here. Be careful not to make the bandage too tight, and remove it briefly every hour or two. Also take aspirin or acetaminophen.
